# Tic-Tac-Toe

Mini Tic-Tac-Toe practice coding challenge, in 3 hours and 45 minutes. Built in JavaScript using the p5.js library for the graphics. All of the necessary features are present, though I would have liked to have made the computer a little smarter with some more time.

The game is playable either at adamrobertson.us/Tic-Tac-Toe or by downloading the files and running index.html through your browser.
